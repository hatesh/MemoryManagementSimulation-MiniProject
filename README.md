# MemoryManagementSimulation-MiniProject
This is a simulation of the memory management component of an operating system. The system will use simple direct memory management (no swapping or paging and no virtual memory).  The simulation will be based around a sequence of process requests, each of which includes the amount of memory needed for the process, plus the process runtime.
